# SQLite shell builder

Builds and publishes SQLite shell with most popular build extensions enabled for different OS.

- Ubuntu 20.04 shell. Because for some reason "Linux Shell" from SQLite website does not work on Ubuntu ðŸ¤·
- Windows shell (64-bit). Because SQLite website only provides 32-bit shell ðŸ¤·
- macOS shell. Just for convenience.

If you need SQLite for Mac M1 (ARM arch), you can easily compile it with included bash script in the `bin/` folder on your local machine.
